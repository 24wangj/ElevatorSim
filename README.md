# ElevatorSim

## Assumptions

- Only one elevator exists
- The only input given is the floor number to go to
- The elevator goes to all floors in its current direction before changing directions
- The elevator has a set speed, and the doors stay open for a set time

## Features Not Implemented

- Multiple concurrent elevators
- Differentiating between calling the elevator on a floor vs. selecting a floor from inside
- Expanding the input to include which direction the elevator is called to optimize when the elevator stops
